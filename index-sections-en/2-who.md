## Who are you?

The PeriodO project is led by [Adam Rabinowitz][adm] (University of Texas at Austin) and [Ryan Shaw][ryn] (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with the cooperation of the [University of Texas Libraries](utl). [Patrick Golden](ptg) is the lead developer of the [PeriodO software][sft]. The PeriodO dataset has been developed largely by our generous contributors. Our work has been funded by a Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant from the [Office of Digital Humanities][odh] at the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a [National Digital Platform grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-16-0009-16) from the [Institute of Museum and Library Services][imls].
