title: Finding and comparing period definitions

In the browsing interface it is possible to find and compare period definitions by applying one of several filters (time range, source, language, spatial coverage) or searching by text string.

To filter by time range, on the right side of the browser window hover over the x-axis of the time range chart to find the desired ISO year. Drag your cursor to select a desired time range, and your selection will appear highlighted in gray in the time range. Period definitions which fall within this time range appear on the left side of the browser window under **Periods**, where you can view between 10 and 250 results at a time. Note that these results remain until you click back in the time range chart to reset the dataset.

To filter by source, locate the desired contributor in the **Source** box (which provides author, collection name, and year of creation/publication): these are listed in descending order by the number of periods contributed to the PeriodO dataset. You can also use `Ctrl+F` to find a contributor by name. Clicking on the desired collection retrieves and displays all periods in that collection, and moves this collection to the top of the **Source** list. Clicking **Reset** on the right of the box causes the interface to display all records in the dataset again.

To filter by language, locate the desired language in the **Language** box: these are listed in descending order by the number of periods contributed to the dataset. You can also use `Ctrl+F` to find a language by name. Clicking on the desired language retrieves and displays all periods entered in that language script, and moves this language to the top of the **Language** list. Clicking **Reset** on the right of the box causes the interface to display all records in the dataset again. 

<img class="screenshot right" alt="Filtering period definitions by spatial coverage." src="/images/filter-by-spatial-coverage.png" width="360">

To filter by spatial coverage (geographic location), locate the desired location in the **Spatial coverage** box: these are listed in descending order by the number of periods contributed to the dataset. You can also use `Ctrl+F` to find a spatial coverage by name. These terms reflect the labels used by the source to describe the periodâ€™s spatial coverage, NOT the coordinate-based geographic entity with which we have associated them. The large quantity of `undefined` values reflect records that could clearly be associated with a modern national boundary, but for which the source did not provide a verbal label for spatial coverage (most of these are from Fasti Online and the British Museum). Clicking on the desired spatial coverage label retrieves and displays all periods associated with that label, and moves this term to the top of the **Spatial coverage** list. Clicking **Reset** on the right of the box auses the interface to display all records in the dataset again.

<img class="screenshot left" alt="Filtering period definitions by text search." src="/images/filter-by-text-search.png" width="217">

To search by text string, enter your text in the search box. Periods containing this text string will display on the left under the **Periods** list.

Results sets derived from filtering or searching can also be recursively filtered using all of the same methods as above, until only one result is left.

A results set can be ordered by label, earliest start, and latest stop, just like the full dataset. This is the simplest way to compare date ranges between period definitions. Clicking within any individual result expands the full period definition, including more detailed information including spatial coverage, permalink for the definition and its collection, and notes.
