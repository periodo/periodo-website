The entire PeriodO dataset can be downloaded as a JSON-LD file from the **Switch backends** page (click on the disk icon). You can also download any datasets you have created in a local database from this page as a JSON-LD file (see [Creating a local database](#creating-a-local-database) below). This can be very useful if you wish to share your periods with someone else, or if you need structured data for your own visualization or data management.

You can also view structured data for an individual authority from the page for that authority. At the top of the browser window, which shows **Browse by Period** by default, click the **Browse by Authority** tab. This will list all of the authorities.

Locate the desired authority (20 are currently viewable at once) by scrolling down or using `Ctrl+F`, and clicking on the source title. This brings you to the page for this authority, which displays authority-level information at the top followed by individual periods below. These periods can be sorted by label, earliest start, or latest stop.
