Anyone can submit new periods or corrections to existing periods to be considered for inclusion in the canonical dataset. To do this, first either [create or edit some periods](#create-or-edit). Then, navigate to **Data source > Submit changes**.

You will be prompted to select a web-based data source to submit your changes to. Typically this will be the canonical data source. After you've made your selection, you will see a **Log in with your ORCID** link.

An [ORCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID) is a unique code for identifying scholarly authors and contributors. It is free to register for an ORCID. Click the login link to enter your ORCID and ORCID account password, or to register for a new ORCID account. PeriodO will never see your ORCID account password: you are logging into `orcid.org`, which then provides a temporary token allowing us to authenticate you.

After successfully logging into the ORCID site, you should see the message **Currently signed in as** followed by whatever name you have registered with ORCID. 

Click **Continue** to see a list of the differences or “changes” between the data source that contains your new or corrected periods and the data source to which you want to submit them.

Select the changes you would like to submit, scroll down to the bottom, and click **Continue**. You will see a summary with only the changes you selected. Click **Submit changes** to confirm, and you should see the message **Submitted changes**. Thanks for your contribution! We will take a look at it ASAP and may contact you with questions.

To check on the status of your submission, navigate to **Home > Data sources** and select the web data source to which you submitted your changes (again, typically this will be the canonical data source). Then navigate to **Data source > Review submitted changes** to see a list of all the submissions that have been made. Your new submission should be on top (unless someone else submitted changes in the meantime). Each submission shows the date and time it was made, who made it, and its status: **Open** means no decision has been made, **Merged** means the changes were accepted, and **Rejected** means the changes were rejected.

Click on a submission's status to see any comments that have been made about the submission, or to download the submitted changes as JSON. (You will also see controls to accept or reject the changes, but unless you are authorized to make changes to the web data source to which the changes were submitted, your acceptance or rejection will fail.)
