To find and view specific authorities, use the **Browse authorities** page. The list of authorities can be sorted by clicking on the column headers. Narrow the list by using the search box to show only matching authorities.

Following the **view** link for an authority in the list will take you to the **Authority > View** page for that period.

Navigating to an individual authority will show its name, creators, and other citable information. Any notes from the original author or the editors who added the authority are shown here too, if they are relevant to the authority as a whole.

As with periods, every authority in the canonical dataset also has been assigned a **Permalink**. Again, you should always use the permalink when referring to an authority or sharing it with others.

To **Download** the authority as structured data (JSON or Turtle), click on the appropriate link.

The rest of the **Authority > View** page works just like [browsing periods](#browse-periods), except that now all the periods belong to a single authority.
