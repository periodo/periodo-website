This is the website for the PeriodO project, built using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
and intended to be hosted on Github Pages.

Most of the content is in Markdown files (the ones with the `.md`
suffix).

To work on the site locally, install [stack](https://www.stackage.org), run `stack setup` and then:

```
$ make watch
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

To deploy to Github Pages:

```
$ make deploy
```
