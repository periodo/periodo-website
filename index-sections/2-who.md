## Who are you?

The PeriodO project is led by [Adam Rabinowitz][adm] (University of Texas at Austin) and [Ryan Shaw][ryn] (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). Patrick Golden developed the [PeriodO software][sft] and [Sarah Buchanan][srh] helped curate the initial dataset. [Eric Kansa][erc] of [OpenContext][ctx] has provided his expertise and support from the beginning. Our work has been funded by a Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant from the [Office of Digital Humanities][odh] at the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a [National Digital Platform grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-16-0009-16) from the [Institute of Museum and Library Services][imls].
