## What is this?

The PeriodO project is creating a gazetteer of scholarly assertions
about the spatial and temporal extents of historical, art-historical,
and archaeological periods. This gazetteer will ease the task of
linking among datasets that define periods differently. It will also
help scholars and students see where period definitions overlap or
diverge. In the long term, it may also help researchers to assign
temporal coordinates to documents that use undefined period terms.
