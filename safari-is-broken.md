## Older versions of Safari are unsupported

Unfortunately the PeriodO client will not run on versions of Safari prior to 9.0, due to [a broken implementation of IndexedDB](http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/9/25/IndexedDB-on-iOS-8--Broken-Bad). In the meantime, please upgrade to Safari 9.0 or use Firefox or Chrome.
