### Day 1: Monday, December 18

**Spatio-temporal reconciliation tools for data curators and catalogers**

_To_ reconcile _is to provide a partial description of some entity of interest, in order to find an identifier that unambiguously identifies the entity. A typical "reconciliation service" takes a partial description in the form of a textual label for the entity (e.g. a place name), and returns a ranked list of identifiers for candidate entities. Entities of interest in the humanities and cultural heritage institutions are described in a wide variety of ways. Descriptions of entities' relations to locations in space and time are especially interesting, as these can be provided both as a wide variety of proper names or natural language descriptions, and as a slimmer variety of both spatial footprints (points or polygons) and temporal extents._ 

**Day 1 schedule**

The Hampton Inn serves a complimentary breakfast. Other nearby options include [Gray Squirrel Coffee Company](https://www.graysquirrelcoffee.com), [Cafe Carrboro](http://www.cafecarrboro.net), and [Rise Biscuits & Donuts](https://risebiscuitsdonuts.com/locations/carrboro/).

**8:30am** Shuttles leave the Hampton Inn for UNC campus. If the weather is suitable, a group will also be walking to campus (about a 20 minute walk on flat terrain).

**9am** Workshop begins at School of Information and Library Science, Manning Hall, Room 01. 

**9–10:30am** Extended introductions: everyone will introduce themselves and provide some (brief!) background on their relevant projects and research.

**10:30–11am** Coffee break

**11–12:30pm** Reconciliation and reconciliation tools. Participants who have built reconciliation tools and who do reconciliation in their work will be asked to talk about their experiences. What are the different ways people are already doing spatiotemporal reconciliation?

**12:30–1:30pm** Lunch

**1:30–4:30pm** Questions and challenges for reconciliation: What are the different use cases for spatiotemporal reconciliation? Is there a use for wider agreement around standard APIs for spatiotemporal reconciliation? 

**4:30pm** Wrap-up

**5:00pm** Shuttles return to the Hampton Inn.

**6:30pm** Dinner at [Venable](http://venablebistro.com).

### Day 2: Tuesday, December 19

**Aggregating spatiotemporal points associated with cultural artifacts**

_When we have large collections of artifact descriptions that employ some combination of textual labels, subject identifiers, and spatiotemporal locations, it becomes possible to aggregate artifact descriptions that link to the same spatiotemporal concept (a place, a period, a person, an organization) and "lift" the cloud of spatiotemporal points associated with those artifacts to the spatiotemporal concept. This cloud becomes yet another way to describe the spatiotemporal extent of the concept._

**Day 2 schedule**

**8:30am** Shuttles leave the Hampton Inn for UNC campus.

**9am** Workshop begins at School of Information and Library Science, Manning Hall, Room 01.

**9–10:30am** Today's topic is a bit more abstract than yesterday's, so we'll begin by trying to make sense of it: why is this interesting?

**10:30–11am** Coffee break

**11–12:30pm** What's been done already? Existing examples of analyzing large collections of descriptions of spatiotemporally located artifacts.

**12:30–1:30pm** Lunch

**1:30–4:30pm** Questions and challenges for aggregating spatiotemporal points: What are the different use cases for this kind of analysis? Visualization? Reconciliation? Search? What approaches are promising? Is there potential for broader collaborations or grant proposals here?

**4:30pm** Wrap-up

**5:00pm** Shuttles return to the Hampton Inn.

**6:30pm** Dinner at [Glasshalfull](https://glasshalfull.net).
