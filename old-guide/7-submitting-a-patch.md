We welcome contributions and enhancements ("patches") to the canonical PeriodO dataset. To submit a patch, you must first register for a free [ORCID](http://orcid.org) so that we can credit you properly. Once you have an ORCID, click **Sign in** at the top of the browser window. You will see a link to **Create or Connect your ORCID iD**.

Clicking this link will open a popup window. From this window you can sign into the ORCID website and grant permission to PeriodO to read your public information (such as your name).

Once you are successfully signed in, you should see your name at the top of the PeriodO window. Now you can open a [local database](#creating-a-local-database) that has the changes or additions that you would like to contribute. Under the **Menu** button in the upper right of the browser window, select **Submit patch to server** and submit your patch. Check that your patch was successfully submitted by selecting **Review patches** (again, under **Menu**) to see a list of the patches submitted to server.
