The entire PeriodO dataset can be downloaded as a JSON-LD file from the **Switch backends** page (click on the disk icon). You can also download any datasets you have created in a local database from this page as a JSON-LD file (see [Creating a local database](#creating-a-local-database) below). This can be very useful if you wish to share your period definitions with someone else, or if you need structured data for your own visualization or data management.

You can also view structured data for an individual collection from the page for that collection. At the top of the browser window, which shows **Browse by Period** by default, click the **Browse by Collection** tab. This will list all of the period collections.

Locate the desired collection (20 are currently viewable at once) by scrolling down or using `Ctrl+F`, and clicking on the source title. This brings you to the page for this collection, which displays collection-level information at the top followed by individual period definitions below. These periods can be sorted by label, earliest start, or latest stop.
